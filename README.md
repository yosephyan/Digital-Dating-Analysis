# Digital-Dating-Analysis
This study utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to analyze initial messages on digital dating platforms, specifically Tinder. The goal is to identify key features in these messages that correlate with digital dating success, defined as longer conversation lengths. We apply four distinct machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, Neural Network using Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forests - to predict the likelihood of successful interactions. This research offers insights into the dynamics of digital dating communication and potential strategies to enhance user experiences on these platforms.
